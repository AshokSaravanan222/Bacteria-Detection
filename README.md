# Medical-Interventions-SkinCancerPaper
For my Medical Interventions PLTW class, I was asked to appoximate the percentage of bacteria that grew on the image of a petri dish. Although this seems like a simple, and straightforward task, I had to get machine learning involved.

In order to do so, I used cv2 and image processing to detect the percentage of bacteria in the 4 follwing four images: MTB, MTF, WTB, WTF (they are in the repo).

Here are some pictures of the differnt steps of the program:

Step 1: Find petri dish circle outline/center split

# Conclusion/Results

I think there were some problems with the implementation of my code, since the results were a little varied when comapred to the control: I think this is because of the lighting. However, I think this is still much better than just appoximating.
